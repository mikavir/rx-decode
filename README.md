GitHub now supports CALLOUTS in Markdown files.
There are some callouts already embedded in this application for you.
However, if you feel that you want to add more, there are certain ones you can use.

NOTE: the preview for callouts isn't yet supported in Gitpod/Codeanywhere/VSCode/etc.
You'll have to commit/push the changes to GitHub to see it in action.

*Please see the responsiveness using [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=http://mikavir.github.io/rx-decoder)*



**Rx Decoder:** Unlock the *Formula*, Master the *Cure*!

A responsive interactive game that can be used in a range of devices. It is aimed for medical professionals to test their expertise in drug names by making them guess the name of the drug with helpful drug actions.


## UX



### Colour Scheme

After researching healthcare web applications, I've discovered that specific colors are recommended for use. Among them, blue stands out as particularly advantageous due to its ability to evoke feelings of trust and security. Incorporating the color blue into the design can foster associations with medical professionalism, enhancing user confidence and comfort. Additionally, I've examined medical websites like [BMJ](https://www.bmj.com/) and the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/), drawing inspiration from their use of blue hues. This analysis has helped me determine the most suitable shade of blue to incorporate into the web application's design, aligning it with established standards and user expectations within the healthcare field.

- `#333` used for primary text.
- `#2a6ebb` used for primary highlights.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/2a6ebb-97b6da-ffffff-333333) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/rx-decoder.png)

These colors serve as visual cues for user feedback on their answers: green signifies correctness, while red indicates an incorrect response.

I have used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/007f3b-ff0000) to generate these colours.

### Typography

Based on research from the [Print Authority](https://theprintauthority.com/best-fonts-for-medical-printed-materials/), I've identified fonts commonly utilized in healthcare-related writing or web applications. One prominent example is QuickSands, which stands out due to its rounded terminals, enhancing readability. Opting for a font traditionally employed in healthcare communication fosters a sense of familiarity within the medical community. By leveraging such fonts, this game aims to resonate more effectively with its target audience, primarily medical professionals. 

- [Quicksands](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand) was used for all text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer and the buttons.

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project,
and describe each in a sentence or so.

You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user,
focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve,
and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

IMPORTANT: Remember to always include a screenshot of each individual feature!

### Existing Features

- **Logo**

    - Incorporating a logo into the game design can offer a powerful visual symbol that resonates with users, fostering a memorable connection to the game. By utilizing a logo with a color scheme harmonious with the game's aesthetic, coherence is maintained, providing users with a consistent and cohesive experience. This approach not only aims to appeal to the intended audience of medical professionals by presenting a clinical image but also contributes to establishing a unique identity for the game itself.
