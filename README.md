*[Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=http://mikavir.github.io/rx-decoder)*



**Rx Decoder:** Unlock the *Formula*, Master the *Cure*!

A responsive, interactive game that can be used on a range of devices. It is aimed at medical professionals to test their expertise in drug names by challenging them to guess the name of the drug along with its helpful actions as hints.


## UX
 
This project was selected with the aim of enhancing familiarity among medical professionals, including myself, with drug names and their corresponding actions.

Acknowledging the time constraints often faced in the medical field, I have developed this game to offer an enjoyable means of learning during leisure moments, while also promoting continuous professional development.

The game's design draws inspiration from the busy schedules of medical professionals, aiming for a clean and minimalist aesthetic to ensure easy comprehension and accessibility.


### Colour Scheme

After researching healthcare web applications, I've discovered that specific colors are recommended for use. Among them, blue stands out as particularly advantageous due to its ability to evoke feelings of trust and security. Incorporating the color blue into the design can foster associations with medical professionalism, enhancing user confidence and comfort. Additionally, I've examined medical websites like [BMJ](https://www.bmj.com/) and the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/), drawing inspiration from their use of blue hues. This analysis has helped me determine the most suitable shade of blue to incorporate into the game's design, aligning it with established standards and meeting user expectations within the healthcare field.

- `#333` used for primary text.
- `#2a6ebb` used for primary highlights.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/2a6ebb-97b6da-ffffff-333333) to generate my colour palette.

These colors serve as visual cues for user feedback: green for correctness and red for incorrect responses.

I have used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/007f3b-ff0000) to generate these colours.

### Typography

Based on research from the  [Print Authority](https://theprintauthority.com/best-fonts-for-medical-printed-materials/), I've identified fonts commonly used in healthcare-related writing or web applications. One prominent example is QuickSands, known for its rounded terminals, which enhance readability. Opting for a font traditionally employed in healthcare communication fosters familiarity within the medical community. By leveraging such fonts, this game aims to resonate more effectively with its target audience, primarily medical professionals.

- [Quicksands](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand) was used for all text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer and the buttons.

### Future Features

- Leaderboards
    - Due to the limited number of drug names available in this game, implementing a leaderboard was deemed inappropriate since the same number of winners would always emerge. However, with an increased pool of drug names to win, introducing a leaderboard would become a desirable feature, allowing for competition among players and adding depth to the gaming experience.


## Development Story

This section will outline the development process of the game. The objective is for users to guess the shuffled drug name. To aid users in progressing during challenging moments, hints will be provided. I will organize this section into distinct features that I have established for the game.

- **Making the box for letter containers**

  - For the visual design, I aimed to represent each letter of the drug name with a corresponding box. Each box should contain the letter's data-set for logic purposes. To achieve this, I created a function that iterates over the `drugName` word, generates a div for each letter, and appends it to the DOM. A similar methodology was employed when implementing the letter containers for the user's guessed word.

```js
function addBox(word) {
  for (let letter of word) {
      let letterPerBox = document.createElement('div');
      letterPerBox.className = "letter-box letter-container";
      letterPerBox.dataset.letter = letter;
      document.getElementById("game-area").appendChild(letterPerBox);
  }
}
```

- **Shuffling the word**

  - To shuffle the letters within the word, I researched methods for shuffling arrays since a word can be viewed as an array of characters. Initially, I adopted the Fisher-Yates algorithm, as explained by [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-shuffle-an-array-of-items-using-javascript-or-typescript/), shown below.

```js
function shuffleArray(arr) {
    for(let i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i+1));
        [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];
        console.log(`${arr[i]} is swapped with ${arr[j]}`);
    }
    console.log(arr);
    return arr;
}
```

  - However, despite the console logs indicating letter swapping during iterations, the word remained unchanged when using this function. This issue is illustrated below:

![screenshot](documentation/shuffling-word-error.png)

  - This have made reconsider my function as the word was not immutable. I have found a solution in [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3943772/how-do-i-shuffle-the-characters-in-a-string-in-javascript) and was inspired by it to make this new function:

```js
  function shuffleWord(word) {
    let shuffledWord = '';
    word = word.split('');
    while (word.length > 0) {
        shuffledWord += word.splice(Math.floor(word.length * Math.random()), 1);
    }
    return shuffledWord;
  }
```

  - This function involves creating a new array and splitting the word array into substrings. The 'while' loop then constructs the shuffled word by selecting random letters returned from the `words.splice()` operation. The function ultimately returns the shuffled word.

- **Drag and Drop**

  - In pursuit of implementing drag and drop mechanics, I conducted research to understand how to create this functionality. Using [Jquery UI](https://jqueryui.com/) [draggables](https://jqueryui.com/draggable/) and [droppable](https://api.jqueryui.com/droppable/) features, I successfully achieved the desired outcome. However, I encountered challenges with the appending of 'draggable letters' to the 'letter containers' due to the default styling and behaviors of jQuery UI, as illustrated in the screenshot below:

  - In order to fix this, I had to override the default styling of jQuery UI with jQuery: 

```js
$('.draggableLetters').css({
    'left': '0px',
});
```

  - Another behavior of jQuery UI draggable appending is the jumping animation it exhibits. This is caused by the `revert: true` statement, which mandates that the draggable element returns to any of the letter containers.

### Acknowledgements


- I would like to thank my Code Institute mentor, [Tim Nelson](https://github.com/TravelTimN) for his support throughout the development of this project. I am very grateful for his encouragement in my pursuit for the drag and drop functionality.
- I would like to thank the [Code Institute Slack community](https://code-institute-room.slack.com) for the moral support; it kept me going during periods of self doubt and imposter syndrome.
